# Simple-Counter

It is a beginner's project. The idea is to click on either one of two buttons which registers a count on the page.
The default counter begins at "0". When you click "Lower count", the counter should decrease by 1. When you click "Add count", the counter should increase by 1.
If the count goes below 0, the number should change color to red. If the count goes above 0, the number should change to green. The default count color is black.
